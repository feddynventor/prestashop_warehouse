# Prestashop Warehouse Interface
### Easily manage products quantities via product barcode
This project is an old Prestashop API interface project that queries the Prestashop database directly for products via the barcode or identifier.
It also updates the availability of the products via adding or subtracting the quantity. 
It offers a good API endpoint, originally interfaced with a mobile app and a smartphone app with a camera.
You can choose between sell and buy (buy as a new product is added to the warehouse availability) so you can scan the product with your phone (or insert the code manually on the web page) to increase (buy) or decrease (sell) the quantity of a product

## DISLAIMER
Please don't use this as there are the official Prestashop APIs that are waaay more reliable to use.
Use this project as a repo to check how to maybe manage a Prestashop database.
